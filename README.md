# Software Engineering (SWE) Interview Coding Problems

Software engineering interviews often involve coding problems that test your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and your problem-solving skills. Here are some of the most common types of problems:

## 1. Array and String Manipulation

These problems often require you to manipulate or traverse arrays or strings to find a solution. Some common examples are:

- "Reverse a String"
- "Find the Duplicate Number in an Array"
- "Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"
- "Rotate an Array"

## 2. Linked Lists

Linked list problems often involve traversal, searching, or modifying the list. Examples include:

- "Reverse a Linked List"
- "Find the Middle of a Linked List"
- "Detect a Cycle in a Linked List"

## 3. Trees and Graphs

These questions involve understanding tree and graph traversals, search algorithms, and sometimes balancing or sorting algorithms. Examples are:

- "Implement a Binary Search Tree"
- "Find the Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree"
- "Implement Depth-First Search/Breadth-First Search on a Graph"
- "Find the Shortest Path Between Two Nodes in a Graph"

## 4. Sorting and Searching

You may be asked to implement or modify classic sorting algorithms or to solve problems that involve searching data. For example:

- "Implement QuickSort/MergeSort"
- "Find the First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array"
- "Search in Rotated Sorted Array"

## 5. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming problems are common in interviews because they test your ability to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Examples include:

- "Climbing Stairs"
- "Longest Increasing Subsequence"
- "Coin Change"
- "Knapsack Problem"

## 6. Design Problems

These problems test your ability to design algorithms and data structures to solve specific problems. They often involve trade-offs between time and space complexity. Examples are:

- "Design a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache"
- "Design a Hashmap"
- "Design a Call Center"

Websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal provide many problems for practice, sorted by difficulty and problem type. Also, books like "Cracking the Coding Interview" offer comprehensive guides to preparing for software engineering interviews.
